# Railway Management System (DBMS Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Railway Management System is a database-based project designed to demonstrate the practical application of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts in a real-world scenario. The system simulates core railway operations such as train scheduling, passenger booking, seat management, and revenue tracking.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply theoretical DBMS concepts to a real-life problem
- Design a structured and relational database
- Implement complex SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis
- Ensure data integrity and efficient relationship management

---

## 🧠 Why This Project?
Railway systems are highly data-intensive and involve continuous data generation through train operations, ticket bookings, and passenger interactions. This makes them an ideal use case for learning and applying DBMS concepts such as tables, relationships, joins, subqueries, and views.

---

## 🗂️ System Features

### 🚆 Train Information
- List all trains with source and destination stations
- Manage train types and seat capacity

### 🌍 City-Based Train Search
- Find trains originating from a specific city using subqueries

### 🎟️ Passenger Booking Management
- Retrieve passengers booked for a particular train
- Track journey dates and seat numbers

### 💰 Views for Analysis
- Revenue generated per journey date
- Seat occupancy compared to total available seats

---

## 🧱 Database Design
The system is designed using an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram that represents:
- Trains
- Stations
- Train Schedules
- Passengers
- Tickets
- Payments

The ER design ensures proper relationships, data consistency, and a realistic workflow from scheduling to ticket booking and payment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Database: MySQL / Oracle
- Query Language: SQL
- SQL Concepts: SELECT, JOIN, SUBQUERY, VIEW, TRIGGER
- Design Methodology: ER Diagram

---

## 📚 Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of complex SQL queries
- Hands-on experience in real-world database design
- Improved knowledge of data integrity and relational constraints
- Experience with views for dynamic reporting and analysis

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
The Railway Management System successfully demonstrates how DBMS principles can be applied to simulate and manage real-life railway operations. The project reflects the complexity and data demands of modern railway networks and serves as a strong academic database project.
